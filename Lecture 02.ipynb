Object-oriented programming is a huge topic of which there are entire courses, and here I am basically going to give one example programmed in a non-object oriented way, and then show how to make it object-oriented, and hopefully you will see the benefits.\n",

    "What is a fraction? Two numbers. There are two obvious ways to glue together two numbers in Python, as a list or as a tuple. So we have a choice to make, should $\\frac{2}{3}$ be $[2,3]$ or $(2,3)$? The choice comes down to whether we want our factions to be changeable or not (the technical term is mutable). Both would be reasonable choices, but we will choose the tuple representation, as numbers and strings in python are immutable, so this better matches what is there already. As a bonus, it make them hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we have made this decision, we need to decide what functions to write, and then write them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, and most complex, function to write is a function that takes a numerator and denominator and returns a tuple containing the fraction. We will call this `fractionMake`. It is complicated as we need to make sure the fraction is in lowest terms, there is no division by zero, and the denominator is not negative. We also code a helper function, `gcd`, which implements the [method of Euclid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) to compute the GCD, which is needed to get the fraction into lowest terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will have a number of functions that take one or two tuples that represent fractions, and do things like add, compare, and convert to string. These are all straightforward.\n"

The good news is that the error only occurs in one direction: if you ask if $x$ is in the filter, if it is there the answer is always yes. But, if $x$ is not in the filter, it will usually say no, but there is a chance it will say yes.\n",

To see if $x$ is in the has table, you check and see if the $hash_i(x)$th element of the bit vector is one, for each of the $h$ different hash functions.\n"

For example, if I have two buckets and a put a coin randomly in one bucket, whether the coin is bucket one and bucket two are not independent, since if the coin is in bucket one, it is not in bucket two! However, if you have 2000 buckets and 1000 coins, there is a $1/2$ chance of a bucket having a coin. But, if you look in a bucket and there is a coin, the chance of all other buckets having a coin goes down to $999/1999=0.49974$, which is an excellent approximation for the $0.5$ if you assumed independence. However, Bloom filters can be fully analyzed without this shortcut using something known as the Azuma–Hoeﬀding inequality, which we do not do here.\n"
